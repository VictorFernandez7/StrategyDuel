HOW TO INSTALL THE ULTIMATE GRIDS ENGINE?
-----------------------------------

To import the asset correctly, follow these steps:

1-	Create a new project from Unity Hub, pick the latest stable version of Unity as your Unity version, and 2D or 3D as the Template. Keep
in mind only Unity 2019.2 and forward versions versions are supported.
2-	Go to the Asset Store window and import the asset (it has to be in an empty project, not an existing one).
3-	You will be warned that importing the asset will overwrite your current project settings (that’s normal), click on Import.
4-	Once this is complete, you’ll most likely get a prompt saying “This Unity Package has Package Manager dependencies”. This is also normal,
click on “Install/Upgrade”.
5-	After that you’ll get a list of the contents of the engine, don’t touch anything, and click on Import in the bottom right corner.
6-	Import will take a while. Once import is complete, a welcome window should prompt (Fig. bellow) if it shows any dependencies are missing 
please click on install for each one and you’re ready to use the engine. Have fun!

In the case you're getting errors on a fresh install follow this last step, else ignore it.
Go to the Window -> Package Manager.
Find and install these packages on this list: 2D Tilemap Editor, Post Processing, CineMachine and TextMesh Pro.
